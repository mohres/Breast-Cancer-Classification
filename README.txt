(Breast Cancer Classification)

In this project, i've built and trained a neural network that can predict from new data whether the breast cancer is "malignant" or "benign". 
In case you would like to retrain your own network you will be using the given CSV data. 
The data has already been split for you into a training and a validation set. If you look at the CSV files, you will notice that the first column corresponds to the ‘diagnosis’ . The values in this column correspond to the diagnosis where a value of 1 indicates a malignant cancer, and a 0 indicates a benign one.

-Getting Your System Ready
You can run this program locally on your machine. Consequently, you will need to have an internet browser, an HTML editor, and a web server installed on your machine. 
Throughout this course we are going to use Chrome as our internet browser, Brackets as our HTML editor and the Web Server for Chrome App as our web server. 
All of these are free and are available for various platforms including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. 

-Web Server for Chrome
To install the Web Server for Chrome App go to the "Web Server for Chrome App" page in the chrome web store.

my_model.json: Contains the model architecture, i.e. the type and size of each layer.
my_model.weights.bin: Contains the weights of the model.
